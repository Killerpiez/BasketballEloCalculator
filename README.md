Uses modified chess elo to calculate the elo of a college basketball team

This was completed as a side project with myself and a friend during college. We took a modified version of chess elo and applied it to the score and outcomes of college basketball games to try and predict the perfect March Madness bracket. We had a success rate of about 80-82% correct when guessing the outcome of the games using a k value of 75 as default.
